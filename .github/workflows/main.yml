# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ gh-actions ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ gh-actions ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Install Qt
        uses: jurplel/install-qt-action@v2.9.0

      - name: Install libusb-dev
        run: sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build
        run: |
          mkdir build
          cd build
          qmake ../rbutil
          make
